# Team Nealth404

## The problem

Team Nealth404 consists of four brothers banded together for the sole purpose of creating a platform that will tackle the health error prevailing in Nepal for decades that includes general ignorance in the health sector in different forms.

## The solution

A proper platform with global accessibility of ease was required. So, we came up with the idea of a mobile app to tackle the issue we saw.

### Framework

The system is written in Dart using Flutter framework. The reason we chose Flutter is because of flexibility it provides us on Android app development world that'll assist us to build our platform.

### General System Flow

The app provides user to quickly access basic health solutions. The app takes care of user accessibility to make it as simple to use as possible.
Registered users and unregistered users will have same user experience until when the app requires proper authentication for certain features.
